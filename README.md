# Current Objectives: 

**Progress so far**  

**Brute Force:** All Functions are tested and verified based on the proposed pseudo-code prompt.
Further optimization will need to be discussed thoroughly..

**FlipDist:** Most functions are working accordingly to the proposed prompt, there still needs to be some more implementations that needs
to be implemented to make sure fully aligning with the prompt.


**Todo List**  

Finish testing and implementing FlipDist functions!!!

Some other detail functions to keep in mind....

-- Scaling/Profiling 
-- Optimize Range updates: perhaps incrementally update only affected path
-- Harden Free-Edge Detection
-- Memoization optimization??
-- Additional Testing(eg empty trees,single nodes, skewed etc )
